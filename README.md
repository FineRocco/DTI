# DTI (BFT-SMaRt Decentralized Token Infrastructure)

DTI is a deterministic wallet-like service that manages coins based on the UTXO (Unspent
Transaction Output) model introduced in Bitcoin and NFT (Non-Fungible Tokens) that can be
transacted using the coins. In this model, each object (coin) represents a certain amount of
currency a user possesses. This means a transaction consumes a given number of input
objects to produce one or two output objects.
